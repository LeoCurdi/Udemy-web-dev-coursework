// why use terminal?
	// can be faster than using a GUI
	// but mainly out of necessity. the terminal provides access that you dont have in the GUI
		// can create and modify hidden files etc
	// also need terminal for many tools such as Node

// vocab
	// shell: the program running on the terminal
	// bash: one of the most popular shells. aka git bash



// Note: file names with a space in them can be handled by putting a \ before the space. ex: coding\ projects


ls // lists all contents of the current directory

dir // equivalent to ls

pwd // tells you what directory youre in

cd <folder name> // moves you into a folder within your current directory
	// can cd multiple in one shot by adding a / between directory names. ex: cd spring/math273
	// can cd an absolute path no matter what dir youre currently in. ex: cd /users/ldcurdi/...
	// can cd to the root directory. ex: cd /
	// can cd to the home directory. ex: cd ~

cd .. // moves you out to the current parent directory
	// can cd .. mutiple times in one shot. ex: cd ../..

mkdir <folder name> // creates a new folder in the current directory

touch <name>.<fileType> // ex: touch notes.txt // create a specific type of file
	// if you touch a file that already exists, it updates the file's last modified time. this is the intended purpose of touch, but it's primarily used to make files

rm <file name>.<file type> // removes a file. WARNING: the file will not go to recycle, it will be completely gone. DO NOT accidentally do this
	// rm cannot be used on folders

rmdir <folder name> // removes a folder. folder has to be empty for it to work
